As a concerned researcher in the field of cybersecurity, I understand the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your systems. Occasionally, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon may cause system malfunctions or conflicts that require their removal.

Purpose

This Tool is intended for use in scenarios where EDR solutions such as CrowdStrike EDR are causing system malfunctions and its removal is deemed necessary. It stops and removes the CrowdStrike service, delete related files, and clean up registry entries and scheduled tasks.

Warning: Use this script at your own risk. This script is designed to remove security software that is protecting your system. Make sure that you have the necessary authorization and that the removal of CrowdStrike EDR is in compliance with your organization's IT policies. Misuse of this script may leave your system vulnerable to threats.
